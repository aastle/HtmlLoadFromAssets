HtmlLoadFromAssets
==================

I am sharing this because I wanted to read an html file from the assets directory and display is in a webview.  However, my attempts at 
using the assets file pattern "file:///android_asset/myfile.html" were unsuccessful.  Therefore, I turned to the AssetManager class to load
my file for me.
